# Diagram-as-Code with Mermaid
This README tutorial will explain how to create class diagrams and sequence diagrams using code. After reading the tutorial, check out the project files for examples of diagram-as-code in practice.

## Why Use Diagram-as-Code?
In a nutshell, there are 3 big reasons:
* It's faster. You type very little in exchange for a well-formatted diagram.
* No separate software; you can make your diagrams in your IDE.
* You can track changes to the diagrams using version control. 
* 

## Requirements 
* VS Code (tested on v1.85.2)
* Markdown Preview Mermaid Support (tested on v1.21.0)
