# Diagram-as-Code with Mermaid
This README tutorial will explain how to create class diagrams and sequence diagrams using code. After reading the tutorial, check out the project files for examples of diagram-as-code in practice.

## Why Use Diagram-as-Code?
In a nutshell, there are 3 big reasons:
* It's faster. You type very little in exchange for a well-formatted diagram.
* No separate software; you can make your diagrams in your IDE.
* You can track changes to the diagrams using version control. 
* It's more reusable.

## Requirements 
* VS Code (tested on v1.85.2)
* Markdown Preview Mermaid Support (tested on v1.21.0)
* Mermaid Documentation: https://mermaid.js.org/intro/

## Installation
1. Download VS Code for your OS: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
2. Follow the VS Code installation guide for your OS:<br>
  * Windows: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows
  * Mac: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac
  * Linux: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux
3. Install the extension Markdown Preview Mermaid Support to render previews of your diagrams: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid

## Sequence Diagrams

### What is a sequence diagram?
A sequence diagram shows you the flow of operations for a particular use case. For instance, in order for another developer to understand implementation of a login feature, you might create a sequence diagram that illustrates step-by-step the communication between client, server, database, etc. More information on this type of UML diagram and its notation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-sequence-diagrams/
